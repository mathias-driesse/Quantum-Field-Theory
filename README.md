# Quantum-Field-Theory

A repository intended for my personal notes in quantum field theory, following the Quantum Field Theory course at the University of Edinburgh, taught by Richard Ball and Luigi Del Debbio. Currently covers canonical quantization and beginning of the path integral approach. In the future, will be updated with more content on renormalization, quantum electrodynamics, electroweak, perturbative and lattice quantum chromodynamics. Written and intended as a reference.
